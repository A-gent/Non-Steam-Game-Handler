# Non-Steam-Game-Handler
Configure the app under the [CONFIG] section in the config.cfg file, then add the exe as a non-steam game and change the name of it in Steam to your chosen app or game.


If you are adding a launcher as the game (such as battle.net launcher for example, so you can launch Diablo or Overwatch with Steam Overlay) then under the [OVERSEE] section you can configure the processes to exit whenever the app's exe under the [CONFIG] section closes (and if under the [SWITCHES] section, the OverseeApplicationExit equals 1) then you can change the "ExitExecutable1" and "ExitExecutable2" and "ExitExecutable3".
